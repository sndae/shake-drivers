#Macdriver
# Introduction #
 Use the most up to date osx,bluetooth and python shake drivers to resolve the issues. If you are using older osx versions the fix below may still be of use.


Minor changes to pyshake.py and new files shake\_viewer.py and bootstrap.py.
Dependency on lightblue, very easy to install. The server will sometimes
fail to connect, to kill the program simply:
control-c to kill the server and again to kill your program.

ISSUE!!!

Writing to shake registers does not work... i have broken it somewhere, will attempt to fix it when I get a moment!

Any problems please email me.
